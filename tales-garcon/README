garcon - menu library

Garcon is an implementation of the freedesktop.org compliant menu
specification. It is based on GLib/GIO and aims at covering the entire
specification except for legacy menus. It was started as a complete
rewrite of the former Xfce menu library called libxfce4menu, which, in
contrast to garcon, was lacking menu merging features essential for
loading menus modified with menu editors.

Garcon covers almost every part of the menu specification except for
legacy menus and a few XML attributes. In contrast to libxfce4menu, it
can also load menus modified with menu editors such as Alacarte as menu
merging is now supported.
