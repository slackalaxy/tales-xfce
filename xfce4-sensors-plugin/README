Sensors
Written by Fabian Nowak, this is a hardware sensors plugin for the
panel. For now, it only works on Linux and requires libsensors to
display your mainboard sensors and fan speeds. Furthermore, it supports
hddtemp to monitor your hard disk's temperature values. 

Usage
Add the plugin to the panel and start checking some checkboxes in the
sensors table. You can specify the color you want the text to appear,
rename the sensor so that the tooltip displays the new name. You can
also display your values graphically, meaning they are displayed by
bars. For those bars, you can specify min and max values which result in
red colored bars, when those min or max values are reached. If you don't
like the green bars, you can check to display colored bars, thus using
the color values specified for each sensor.
