xfce4-power-manager - Power Manager

Xfce4 Power Manager manages the power sources of the computer and
connected devices (wireless mice, keyboards, media players etc). It also
allows users to control the display backlight brightness and set power-
saving modes for displays and monitors.

In addition, xfce4-power-manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant
DBus interfaces to inform other applications about the current power
level so that they can adjust their power consumption, and it provides
the inhibit interface which allows applications to prevent automatic
sleep actions via the power manager; as an example, the operating
system's package manager should make use of this interface while it is
performing update operations.
