Xfce4-screenshooter

The Xfce4-screenshooter is an application that can be used to take
snapshots of your desktop screen. This application allows you to capture
the entire screen, the active window or a selected region. You can set
the delay that elapses before the screenshot is taken and the action
that will be done with the screenshot: save it to a PNG file, copy it to
the clipboard, open it using another application, or host it on Imgur, a
free online image hosting service.
