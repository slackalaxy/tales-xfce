xfce4-places-plugin - Places
Originally written by Diego Ongaro, this plugin is a menu with quick
access to folders, documents, and removable media. The places plugin
brings much of the functionality of GNOME's Places menu to Xfce.

The plugin puts a simple button on the panel. Clicking on this button
opens up a menu with the following:

System-defined directories (home folder, trash, desktop, file system)
Removable media (using thunar-vfs)
User-defined bookmarks (reads ~/.gtk-bookmarks)
Search program launcher (optional)
Recent documents submenu (requires GTK+ v2.10 or greater)
