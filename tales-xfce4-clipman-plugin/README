Clipman - xfce4-clipman-plugin

Clipman is a clipboard manager for Xfce. It keeps the clipboard contents
around while it is usually lost when you close an application. It is
able to handle text and images, and has a feature to execute actions on
specific text by matching them against regular expressions.

Anatomy of a Clipboard
In X11 (all Unix platforms) there are by default two clipboards to
exchange any data between the windows. A default clipboard which is
modified by manual copies (for instance when you select a file and press
the copy button), and there is a primary clipboard which is modified by
selections (for instance when you select text in a field).

Clipman handles only the default clipboard, but optionally it can also
notice the selections. When it is handling the selections, the default
clipboard will always be synced with it and contain the same data. By
this meaning you can paste with the keyboard what you select on screen.
