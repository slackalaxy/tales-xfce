CpuFreq

Originally written by Thomas Schreck, this panel plugin shows
information about the CPU governor and frequencies supported and used by
your system. At the moment, changing any of these settings is not
supported by this plugin but might be implemented in future releases.

Usage
From the configuration dialog, which is available by right-clicking on
the panel widget, select the CPU which you want to monitor in the panel.
Instead of showing values for a single CPU, you can alternatively choose
minimum, average or maximum, which might make more sense on a multi-core
system. If your system is using the Intel pstate driver, the current
maximum will be chosen by default, as this is what other monitoring
applications like i7z show as the current real performance.

The remaining options on the configuration dialog let you customize the
panel widget layout and what data is shown on the panel.

The overview window can be accessed by left-clicking on the panel plugin
widget, or from the context menu, similar to the configuration dialog.
It shows detailed information for every CPU (core).
