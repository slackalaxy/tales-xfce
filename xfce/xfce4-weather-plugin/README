Weather

Originally written by Bob Schlärmann, this panel plugin shows
information about your local weather in the panel, using forecast data
provided by met.no.

Usage
The first time you open the configuration dialog, the weather plugin
automatically configures itself to fetch weather data from a place which
should be near you - based on your IP address. It will also try to
determine the units used in your country, but you can alter these on the
units page.

You can change this location using the Change… button and searching for
the city, country, address, monument etc. you're interested in. Only
latitude, longitude and altitude will be used for the data requests, so
you can change the location name to something you like. There is a
further tab for appearance settings and one for customizing data visible
in the scrollbox.

On the panel icon, a middle click forces an update, left click brings up
a forecast and details page. Right-clicking opens the contextual menu.

There are a lot of tooltips describing the options and values available.

NOTE: To save power, the plugin stops animation and deactivates other
CPU-consuming settings when your laptop is on battery. Remember this
when you try to change settings, as some results may only be visible
when the A/C adapter is attached! If you don't like this feature, there
is a hidden setting to turn it off, see the README file.
