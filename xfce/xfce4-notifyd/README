xfce4-notifyd - Xfce Notification service

Xfce4-notifyd is a notification service for the Xfce Desktop that
implements most of the "server-side" portion of the Freedesktop desktop
notifications specification. Applications that wish to pop up a
notification bubble in a standard way can make use of the xfce4-notifyd
service by sending standard messages over D-Bus using the
org.freedesktop.Notifications interface.
