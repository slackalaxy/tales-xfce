Thunar Volume Manager (thunar-volman)

The Thunar Volume Manager is an extension for the Thunar file manager,
which enables automatic management of removable drives and media. For
example, if thunar-volman is installed and configured properly, and you
plug in your digital camera, it will automatically launch your preferred
photo application and import the new pictures from the camera into your
photo collection.

The advantage of Thunar Volume Manager over other solutions (like gnome-
volume-manager or ivman) is that it does not require an additional
daemon to be running in the users desktop session, which means it is a
very lightweight solution. In addition, the Thunar Volume Manager
smoothly integrates into the Thunar file manager and the Xfce desktop.

It was designed to look and behave similar to gnome-volume-manager to
get consistent removable drive and media management in Xfce and GNOME.
This is to help GNOME refugees and people using both Xfce and GNOME.
